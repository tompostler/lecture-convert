LECTURECONVERT: Must have one INPUTDIR

Usage: lectureconvert [OPTIONS] INPUTDIR
Download recorded .mp4 lecture files and convert them into sped up and
normalized .mp3s with proper id3 tags for easier on-the-go consumption.

Each line in the input.txt text file for the downloaded recordings should be
set up as follows for each line:
   URL/to/file|TrackTitle

The resulting filename will be gleaned from the above information, and the
filename gleaned from TrackTitle will be normalized so there are no offending
characters or spaces for the current filesystem. Additionally, track numbering
will simply be performed sequentially within the file starting at 1.
The file name is formed as follows:
   AlbumName_TrackTitle.mp[3|4]

Options:
      --help, -h, -?         Print this help text and die.
      --ffmpeg-processes, --fp=VALUE
                             The maximum number of ffmpeg processes to let run
                               at one time. FFMpeg is generally constrained by
                               the CPU, so this defaults to Environment.
                               ProcessorCount.
      --sox-processes, --sp=VALUE
                             The maximum number of sox processes to let run at
                               one time. Sox is generally constrained by the
                               disk, so this defaults to 2.

INPUTDIR:
        The input file to parse for URLs, file naming, and id3 tag information.
