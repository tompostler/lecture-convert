    Usage: lectureconvert [OPTIONS] INPUTFILE
    Download recorded .mp4 lecture files and convert them into sped up and
    normalized .mp3s with proper id3 tags for easier on-the-go consumption.

    Each line in the input text file for the downloaded recordings should be set up
    as follows for each line:
       URL/to/file|AlbumName|TrackTitle

    The resulting filename will be gleaned from the above information, but it does
    not bother to check if you gave it a sensical name or not. Additionally, track
    numbering will simply be performed sequentially within the file starting at 1.
    The file name is formed as follows:
       AlbumName_TrackTitle.mp[3|4]

    Options:
          --help, -h, -?         Print this help text and die.
          --dir, -d=VALUE        The top level directory to use for execution. A
                                   input.txt file containing the lecture
                                   information should be within this directory
                                   instead of specifying INPUTFILE.
          --ffmpeg-processes, --fp=VALUE
                                 The maximum number of ffmpeg processes to let run
                                   at one time. FFMpeg is generally constrained by
                                   the CPU, so this defaults to Environment.
                                   ProcessorCount.
          --sox-processes, --sp=VALUE
                                 The maximum number of sox processes to let run at
                                   one time. Sox is generally constrained by the
                                   disk, so this defaults to 2.

    INPUTFILE:
            The input file to parse for URLs, file naming, and id3 tag information.
